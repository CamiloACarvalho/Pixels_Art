# Pixels Art - An Interactive DOM Color Palette

Welcome to my amazing **Pixels Art** project! üåà

This challenging project aimed to create an interactive color palette that allows you to select a color and paint squares. You can also switch between different palettes and clear the 'canvas' with a single click.

## Technologies Used

- HTML (not used for the project itself)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation)
- CSS

**What makes this project stand out?** üöÄ

The major highlight of this project is that everything was built directly in the Document Object Model (DOM). Surprisingly, **no HTML was used**! An innovative approach showcasing my DOM manipulation skills.

## How to Use

- Simply open the project in a web browser.
- Select a color from the palette.
- Click on a square to paint it.
- Try out different palettes and clear the screen whenever you want!
